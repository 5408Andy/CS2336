Use integer array to mark color of node
	-1 = colorless
	1 = color1
	2 = color2
Add starting vertex to queue
Mark vertex color1
While queue not empty 
	Dequeue node 
	For each neighbor 
		If neighbor colorless 
			Mark color of neighbor opposite color of current node 
			Add neighbor to queue 
		If neighbor colored and neighbor color == current node color 
			not bipartite graph
If the loop finishes, Bipartite graph
